This program was made as a personal project to learn Java network programming. The concept of it is rather simple, all it does is send messages to a server which, in turn, sends the message to everyone else (aside from some other commands added). Although the license is MIT, please consider also disclosing the source-code under an open-source license. It helps to give back to the community and help others just like this may have helped you.
